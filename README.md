Greetings! I'm Erika Binti Hawapi, a dedicated student navigating the exciting academic journey at the University Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). I'm currently into Computer Science (Graphics And Multimedia Software).

University life isn't just about textbooks and lectures! When not immersed in the world of coding, you'll find me navigating the waters with a kayak paddle in hand. UTM offers more than just classrooms; it's a canvas for personal growth and adventure.
