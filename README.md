Greetings! I'm Erika Binti Hawapi, a dedicated student navigating the exciting academic journey at the University Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). I'm currently into Computer Science (Graphics And Multimedia Software).

University life isn't just about textbooks and lectures! When not immersed in the world of coding, you'll find me navigating the waters with a kayak paddle in hand. UTM offers more than just classrooms; it's a canvas for personal growth and adventure.

Fuelled by the spirit of discovery, my academic journey is a stepping stone towards my system developer goal. Every challenge faced and every lesson I learned at UTM is shaping the narrative of my future success. Embark on this academic journey with me, where every lesson is a step forward, and every experience is a chapter worth remembering!
For any inquiries or communication, feel free to contact me via email at erikahawapi123@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
